Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving multiple values in a single column
ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
Perform a UNION SQL injection to retrieve multiple values (like username and password) in a single column from the database.
ðŸ§ª Steps:
Access the Lab:
Open the lab.
Use Burp Suite to capture the request when selecting any category (for example, Gifts).
Send the captured request to the Repeater.
Find the Number of Columns and a Text-Compatible Column:
First, find the number of columns using ORDER BY or UNION SELECT NULL methods.
Then find which column accepts text.
In repeater-
GET /filter?category=Accessories' UNION SELECT NULL, 'a'--
If you get an HTTP 200 OK response, it confirms that:
There are 2 columns.
The second column accepts text values.
Construct the UNION Payload to Retrieve Data:
Now we want to combine two fields (username and password) into a single text output.
Use the SQL string concatenation operator (||) to combine them:
You can first check which database is used and then you can construct the payload accordingly for retrieving multiple values in a single column.
GET /filter?category=Accessories' UNION SELECT NULL, username||'~'||password FROM users--
Here:


username||'~'||password joins the username and password together separated by a ~.
|| is the string concatenation operator in PostgreSQL (some databases use CONCAT() instead if || doesn't work so check first the database).
View the Response:
Right-click in Burp Repeater â†’ Show Response in Browser.


Copy and paste the URL into your browser.


You'll see usernames and passwords combined like:
carlos~kspjyp1c532tfuc8y1kp
administrator~evrq1pkrjdmxeigdlvwl
wiener~99b2c94banvpmnmi6xmw

Login as Administrator:
Go to the My Account section.
Login using the administrator username and its corresponding password.
ðŸ’¥ Boom! Lab solved!


ðŸ§  Why This Works:
Normally, each column can only return one field.
To retrieve both username and password together in one column, we concatenate them using ||.
This tricks the SQL output to return two different fields combined into a single visible column.
