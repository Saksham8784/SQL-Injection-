Lab: SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function.         
In this lab we will learn how to inject SQLi in a login page.
🧪 Steps:
	1	Start the lab – Click “Access the Lab” and go to the My Account section.
	2	You’ll see a login page asking for a username and password.
	3	In the Username field, enter the following payload: ' OR 1=1--
	4	Type anything in the Password field (e.g., 1234).
	5	Hit Login.
💥 Boom! You're logged in as the admin user.
🧠 How it Works:
	•	The payload ' OR 1=1-- breaks the intended SQL query:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1--' AND password = 'random'
	•	' closes the string opened by the input.
	•	OR 1=1 is always true, so it bypasses the password check.
	•	-- is a SQL comment, ignoring the rest of the query (i.e., the password condition).
🚀 This tricks the database into logging you in without verifying the password.
